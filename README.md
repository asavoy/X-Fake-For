# X-Fake-For

This is a Chrome extension to add the `X-Forwarded-For` heading to your requests to fool some sites' geo-blocking attempts.

I'm keeping this informal and not releasing this onto the Chrome Store. To install:

* `git clone git@github.com:damncabbage/X-Fake-For.git`,
* Open Settings and go to the Extensions tab. (Alternatively, visit `chrome://extensions`.)
* Tick "Developer Mode" (top-right).
* Click "Load unpacked extension...", and select the X-Fake-For directory. 
* Visit a geoblocked site and punch the `[-]` button.

Doesn't work on Hulu. Works in a few other places.
